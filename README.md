# Next.js Starter

This is my boilerplate for my next.js project. _Don't take too long to get started!_.

## Features

#### ✅ Typescript

#### ✅ TSLint

#### ✅ Path alias resolved

This feature actually needs improvement, still using manual configuration on tsconfig, webpack and jest

#### ✅ Test with [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/ 'Testing Library')

#### ✅ Start with perfect audit

## Get Started

Just clone this repository and remove the `.git` folder

    git clone https://github.com/GifaEriyanto/nextjs-starter.git

Or you can use CLI with `Reactism`

    npm i -g reactism

and then run this command:

    reactism create yourproject

And Done! You can start your project now.

_let us know if something goes wrong, enjoy your code!!!_
